# library-store

## This project focuses on a library management system that includes various entities such as staff, books, authors, publishers, and other related tables. The system enforces specific borrowing rules based on the type of library member:

### For Students: The maximum number of books that can be borrowed is 5, and the borrowing period is 15 days.

### For Faculty: The maximum number of books that can be borrowed is 10, and the borrowing period is 30 days.

#### The database design adheres to normalization principles and satisfies Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), ensuring there are no many-to-many relationships. This structure promotes data integrity, reduces redundancy, and supports efficient querying and management of library operations.
